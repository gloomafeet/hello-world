# hello-world
Just for practice
Hello I am 16 and love coding. But I don't know what to follow: passion or money.
I am good in both biology and mathematics.
If 
  I choose Maths
  Then:
    I would like to become a game dev
  Elif
    I choose Bio
   Then
    I become doctor
    
 The former is my passion while the latter attracts money
